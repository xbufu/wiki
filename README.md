# Bufu-Sec Wiki

The wiki will contain all my notes and cheatsheets mostly related to Red Teaming. It uses the popular [doks](https://github.com/h-enk/doks) theme.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute by making a pull request. You can also just use this repo as a template to create your own wiki and host it on Github Pages.

### Adding more Sections

I initially had some trouble setting up more than one `docs` section from the original theme and getting the search to work, but here are some references to help get you set up:

- [test-wiki commit 79c667f](https://github.com/xbufu/test-wiki/commit/8d4ff9b089a618e9319de1f3e986f87acd609417)

![Doks â€” Modern Documentation Theme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/h-enk/doks/master/images/tn.png)

## Demo

- [doks.netlify.app](https://doks.netlify.app/)

## Why Doks?

Nine main reasons why you should use Doks:

1. __Security aware__. Get A+ scores on [Mozilla Observatory](https://observatory.mozilla.org/analyze/doks.netlify.app) out of the box. Easily change the default Security Headers to suit your needs.

2. __Fast by default__. Get 100 scores on [Google Lighthouse](https://googlechrome.github.io/lighthouse/viewer/?gist=7731347bb8ce999eff7428a8e763b637) by default. Doks removes unused css, prefetches links, and lazy loads images.

3. __SEO-ready__. Use sensible defaults for structured data, open graph, and Twitter cards. Or easily change the SEO settings to your liking.

4. __Development tools__. Code with confidence. Check styles, scripts, and markdown for errors and fix automatically or manually.

5. __Bootstrap framework__. Build robust, flexible, and intuitive websites with Bootstrap 5. Easily customize your Doks site with the source Sass files.

6. __Netlify-ready__. Deploy to Netlify with sensible defaults. Easily use Netlify Functions, Netlify Redirects, and Netlify Headers.

7. __Full text search__. Search your Doks site with FlexSearch. Easily customize index settings and search options to your liking.

8. __Page layouts__. Build pages with a landing page, blog, or documentation layout. Add custom sections and components to suit your needs.

9. __Dark mode__. Switch to a low-light UI with the click of a button. Change colors with variables to match your branding.

### Other features

- __Multilingual and i18n__ support
- __Versioning__ documentation support
- __KaTeX__ math typesetting
- __Mermaid__ diagrams and visualization
- __highlight.js__ syntax highlighting

## Requirements

Doks uses npm to centralize dependency management, making it [easy to update](https://getdoks.org/docs/help/how-to-update/) resources, build tooling, plugins, and build scripts:

- Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (it includes npm) for your platform.

## Get started

Start a new Doks project in three steps:

### 1. Create a new site

Doks is available as a child theme, and a starter theme:

- Use the Doks child theme, if you do __not__ plan to customize a lot, and/or need future Doks updates.
- Use the Doks starter theme, if you plan to customize a lot, and/or do __not__ need future Doks updates.

Not quite sure? Use the Doks child theme.

#### Doks child theme

git clone https://github.com/h-enk/doks-child-theme.git my-doks-site && cd my-doks-site
```

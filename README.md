# Bufu-Sec Wiki

The wiki will contain all my notes and cheatsheets mostly related to Red Teaming. It uses the popular [doks](https://github.com/h-enk/doks) theme.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute by making a pull request. You can also just use this repo as a template to create your own wiki and host it on Github Pages.

### Adding more Sections

I initially had some trouble setting up more than one `docs` section from the original theme and getting the search to work, but here are some references to help get you set up:
